# Emerald
A simple Discord bot built with Discord.js and Commando.

### Disclaimer: I have no idea what the fuck I'm doing with this bot. 

Now that that's out of the way, here's some of the things this bot has so far: 
- Couple of handy commands for specific use cases like avatar-role color syncing, message expiry and role greetings
- Decent XP system that I don't even use anywhere because why not
- Overengineered context system used everywhere (`ctx.` all the things)
- Zero attention paid towards the database (migrations? what's that?)
- Integration with [NadekoConnector](https://github.com/rjt-rockx/NadekoConnector) for self hosted NadekoBots
- Non-existent documentation through JSDoc comments

### Interested?

Here's an [invite link](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=510453927477510154&permissions=8&scope=bot) to add the bot. I make no guarantees when it comes to uptime, though it should be fairly decent. 

If the stars align and somehow make you decide to contribute to this bot, feel free to fork it and submit a pull request. 
Any and all contributions are welcome as long as they are meaningful. 

Feel free to reach out to me on Discord at [rjt#2336](https://discord.com/users/192060404501839872) for help/support.
